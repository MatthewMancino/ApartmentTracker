In order to implement this project effectively I made three design decisions:

1)Creating an array of Heap-based Priority Queues - In the initial driver program, AptTracker.java, I chose to create an array of Priority Queues.
The first heap in the array organizes all the apartment by lowest rent. The second element in the array is the heap
that organizes all apartments by highest squarefeet. For the subsequent elements, i, I used a hashtable as indirection for the cities 
themselves. Meaning on add(), I take the apartment's city and hash it to an index corresponding to two NEW PQs for that city(One for rent,
one for High SQFT) This is the most efficient because when we want to find the lowest rent by city, all we have to do is hash the city string
then use the value as PQ array index. This makes constant run-time O(1) for options 4,5,6,7.

2)Using StringBuilder as a HashString.   In addition to using indirection in the driver program. I additionally used indirection
within the PQ itself. on add(), I take the address, apartment number, and Zip code and append them together and use it all as one 
key for the hashtable within the PQ itself. This prevents apartments that have the same address, num, or zip code from being 
replaced when a new value is entered. This does not create a considerable increase in run-time because it is O(n) run-time to create
all HashStrings for all apartments, which due to the nature of the program, the size of n is small enough that it does not have considerable
increases in run-time.

3)Array-based PQ - Using an array-based PQ was necessary to implement an indirection hash function effectively. 
This is the most efficient because we can still remove and add an item at O(lgn) run-time as a maximum.

Overall, the space-complexity of ApartmentDriver.java might have extraneous space use due to the initialization amount being 100. but this is a safety measure that can be altered simply by asking a user for an input of the amount of apartments used.
